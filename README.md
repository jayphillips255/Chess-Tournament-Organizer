# Chess-Tournament-Organizer
Allows users to create and operate chess tournaments.

## What I've done on this Project
Player.cs, Tournament.cs, ITournamentService.cs, TournamentService.cs, Tournaments.vue, CreateNewTournament.vue, ConductTournament.vue, and minor alterations to other files. This project uses the Coalesce framework https://intellitect.github.io/Coalesce/ 

## At a Glance
The purpose of this software is to make running a chess tournament easy. Pairings for each round are done automatically. For swiss tournaments, a player is paired with an opponent with the same score, avoiding rematches. Each player's score is automatically updated after each round, ready for the next round.

## What's Next
- Pairing algorithms for Round Robin and Single Elimination.
- Half point bye system, so players who can't participate in a round can still finish a tournament
